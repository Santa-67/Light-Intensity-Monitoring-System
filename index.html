            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project is a cloud-based light intensity monitoring system designed to track real-time light levels in various environments. The system utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) connected to a Raspberry Pi model, which measures the intensity of light.</p>
            <p>The collected data is sent to Firebase Cloud, where it is stored securely along with a timestamp. This allows users to monitor changes in light intensity over time, making it ideal for applications in smart homes, greenhouses, and other environments where light levels need to be monitored.</p>
            <p>The data, along with its respective timestamp, can be viewed and monitored on a web page, providing a user-friendly interface for tracking light levels.</p>
